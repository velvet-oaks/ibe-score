# OVERVIEW

## Branch Spec (rob-adding-ui-elements)

This Branch is adding purely visual, non functional components to the Upload/Downlaod
page. This is to satisfy the client and to placate them whilst we work on the functional
compnents.

---

### TODO

* Populate Upload/Download with the following (see screen shots below)
* * Hand Records
* * BridgeWebs
* * HTML/PDF
* * EBU P2P File

### The client will eventually want more of the existing components, but for now this is enough to take to market
